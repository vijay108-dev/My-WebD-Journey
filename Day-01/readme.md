|  **Purpose**           |  **What it does**                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|  Page Structure         | Defines headings, paragraphs, images, links          |
|  Hyperlinking           | Connects one page to another                         |
|  Media Embedding        | Adds videos, images, audio                           |

Q3: Is HTML a programming language?
 No, HTML is not a programming language.
 It is a markup language — it describes structure, not logic.

 Hindi:
HTML me conditions, loops, variables nahi hote.
Yeh sirf design ka framework banata hai.


 Hypertext = What you see and click
 Hyperlink = Where it takes you
 Both are part of the <a> (anchor) tag in HTML

 Hindi:
Hypertext = dikhne wala clickable text
Hyperlink = uske peeche chhupa hua address
